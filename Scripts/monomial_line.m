function [shp,shpx] = monomial_line(p,x)
% MONOMIAL_LINE computes monomials in 1d
% INPUTS:
%   p: polynomial order; must be 1 or 2.
%   x: np by 1 matrix of evaluation points; np is the number of nodes.
% OUTPUTS:
%   shp: np by 2 (or 3) matrix containing monomial basis functions
%        evaluated at x.  The number of columns is 2 and 3 for linear and
%        quadratic polynomials, respectively.
%   shpx: np by 2 (or 3) matrix containing the derivative of the
%         monomial basis functions evaluated at x.  The number of columns 
%         is 2 and 3 for linear and quadratic polynomials, respectively.
